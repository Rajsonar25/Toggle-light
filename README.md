Light Control App ✨ is an interactive web application built using React that simulates a simple light control system. Users can toggle the state of a light bulb 💡 by clicking buttons to turn it on or off. The app visually represents the light state by changing the image displayed on the screen, offering a user-friendly interface to demonstrate basic state management in React.

Features:
Dynamic Image Display: The application shows an image of a light bulb that changes based on its current state (on or off). 🔄
Interactive Buttons: Users can click "Turn On" 🔆 and "Turn Off" ⏹ buttons to control the light state, triggering an immediate visual response.
State Management: Utilizes React's useState hook to manage the light's state efficiently, demonstrating the principles of component reactivity and stateful components. ⚙️
Technologies Used:
React.js: For building the user interface and managing application state. 🚀
CSS: For styling the application, ensuring a clean and appealing visual presentation. 🎨
JavaScript: For implementing the logic of the application, including event handling and state updates. 📜
Goals:
To provide a simple yet effective demonstration of state management in React. 📈
To enhance understanding of event handling and conditional rendering in a React application. 🔍
To create an engaging user experience that showcases the capabilities of React in building interactive web applications. 🎉
Target Audience:
This project is aimed at beginner to intermediate developers interested in learning or enhancing their skills in React, as well as anyone looking for a simple application that illustrates fundamental concepts of web development. 👩‍💻👨‍💻
